# Illustrative Examples for SCR work

## To Do:
- ~~Add modify readout for Theorem 3.1, how do we only read the first n entries?~~
- ~~Compare prediction results on SCR and randomized reservoirs on X data set. (X to be decided later.)~~
- Fix: the perturbation to the "next" closest eigenvalue is unique, the code should be modified as such.

## Log: 
- Apr 19: Added dilation construction (U, Section 3, Theorem 3.1)
- Aug 18: Resumed development. Completed LRC + LRO forecasting pipeline
- Aug 23: Unitary / Orthogonal Dilation done. Almost done roots-of-unity completion.
- Aug 29: Roots-of-Unity completion should be ok, observe that if we increase the n large enough then maybe it can handle any input mtx of dim n..
    -- Should we re-write closest cycle as optimization?
- Oct: Moving change log to Apple Reminders for ease of use..
